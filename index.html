    <h3>About xyz</h3>
    <p>
      xyz was founded by a computer science graduate and working app developer with a deep curiosity for how software works — piece by piece.
      Beyond delivery, the goal is to build meaningful products and create opportunities for developers through mentorship and hands-on learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      We don’t mass-produce apps. Every product is crafted with intention, ownership, and long-term maintainability in mind.
